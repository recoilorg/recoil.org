##Â Build

This runs using a pre-release version of Svelte 5, so will need updating once it's out.

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm dev` - Spin up the local server on http://localhost:5173
3. `pnpm build` - Output the static site into the build/ directory

## Notes

This is an initial minimal build so we find it easier to maintain and extend
